<h1>Directions</h1>
This is an <em>individual </em>assignment. You may not work with others. Please regularly check <em>EdStem </em>throughout this course for project specification clarifications. You are required to version control your code, but please only use the GitHub repository created for you by the 5480 staff. Do not work in public GitHub repositories! Please avoid publishing this project at any time, even post-submission, to observe course integrity policies.

<h1>Overview</h1>
In this assignment you will implement a basic shell named <em>penn-shredder </em>that will restrict the runtime of executed processes. Your shell will read input from the user and execute it as a new process, but if the process exceeds a timeout, it will be terminated. You will complete this assignment using only a specified set of Linux system calls and standard C library functions.

<h1>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specification</h1>
At its core, a shell is a simple loop. Upon each iteration, the shell prompts the user for a program to run, executes the program as a separate process, and waits for the process to finish. The shell exits the loop when the user presses Ctrl-D at the prompt. Your shell, <em>penn-shredder</em>, will do all of that, but with a slight twist.

<em>penn-shredder </em>takes a command line argument that specifies a timeout for the user-entered program. If any program runs for longer than the specified timeout, <em>penn-shredder </em>will terminate the program and report to the user his snide catch-phrase, ‚ÄúBwahaha ‚Ä¶ Tonight, I dine on turtle soup!‚Äù. The following is an example of input that should invoke the catch-phrase:

<table width="633">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="633">$ penn-shredder 2 penn-shredder# /bin/sleep 3

Bwahaha ‚Ä¶ Tonight, I dine on turtle soup!

penn-shredder# /bin/sleep 1 penn-shredder#
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Compiled 2023-01-12 03:12

&nbsp;

Here, <em>penn-shredder </em>was executed with a timeout argument of 2 seconds, and any program that runs longer than 2 seconds will be terminated (or shredded). The sleep program with an argument of 3 seconds was terminated after exceeding the timeout. Conversely, sleep 1 completes before the timeout, without upsetting Shredder and his henchmen.

We will give you the Makefile used by the autograder. In your C source code, you should use the two macros PROMPT and CATCHPHRASE defined in the Makefile instead of defining your own macros. See the skeleton code below.

1.1 read, fork, exec, wait, and repeat!

As described previously, a shell is just a loop performing the same procedure over and over again. Essentially, that procedure can be completed with these system calls:

<ul>
<li>write(2) : write the prompt to stderr</li>
<li>read(2) : read input from stdin into a buffer</li>
<li>fork(2) : create a new process that is a copy of the current (parent) process</li>
<li>execve(2) : replace the current (child) process with another</li>
<li>wait(2) : wait for a child process to finish before proceeding</li>
</ul>
Your program, in skeleton code, should look like this:

<table width="633">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="633">while (1) { write(STDERR_FILENO, PROMPT, ‚Ä¶); read(STDIN_FILENO, ‚Ä¶); pid = fork(); if (pid == 0) { execve(‚Ä¶); perror(‚Ä¶); exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

}

if (pid &gt; 0) wait(‚Ä¶);

}
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
You should spend some time carefully reading the man pages for all of these systems calls. To do so, in a docker terminal enter:

$ man 2 read

where 2 specifies the manual section. If you do not specify the manual section, you may get information for a different read command.

<ul>
<li>Timing is Everything</li>
</ul>
To time a running program, your shell will use the alarm(2) system call, which simply tells the operating system to raise a SIGALRM signal after a specified time. Your shell may need to catch the signal to avoid being terminated by the signal.

To handle a signal, a signal handing function must be registered with the operating system via the signal(2) system call. When the signal is delivered, the operating system will interrupt your shell‚Äôs current operations (e.g., waiting for the program to finish).

<ul>
<li>Hit the kill switch!</li>
</ul>
The kill(2) system call send a signal to a process. Despite its morbid name, it will only <em>kill </em>(or terminate) a program if the right signal is delivered. One such signal which will <em>always </em>do just that is SIGKILL. This signal has the special property that it cannot be caught or ignored, so no matter what program your shell executes, it must heed the signal.

<ul>
<li>Prompting and I/O</li>
</ul>
Your shell must prompt the user for input. See Section 1.1 above. Following the prompt, your shell will read input from the user. The system call read(2) will return when the user presses Enter or Ctrl-D. The maximum line length is 4095 bytes (plus the terminating newline character if the user pressed Enter). It‚Äôs recommended that you call read(2) as follows:

const int maxLineLength = 4096; char cmd[maxLineLength];

int numBytes = read(STDIN_FILENO, cmd, maxLineLength);

If the user presses Ctrl-D after typing something, you should print a newline before executing the program or re-prompting as if the Enter key were pressed.

<ul>
<li>Argument Delimiters</li>
</ul>
The user-entered program may have arguments which are whitespace (space and tab) delimited. There may be leading and trailing whitespaces from the user input. For example:

<table width="633">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="164">penn-shredder#</td>
<td width="92">/bin/sleep</td>
<td width="377">10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>Executing a Program</li>
</ul>
Your shell may only use the execve(2) system call to execute a program. This system call instructs the operating system to replace the current running program ‚Äì that would be the child of your shell ‚Äì with the specified program. Please refer to the manual for more details.

The execve(2) system call is the base of a larger collection of functions; however, you may not use those other functions. Specifically, you may not use execl(3), execv(3)), or any other function listed in the exec(3) man page. As a result, the user of your shell must specify the path to a program to execute it. To learn where a program <em>lives </em>(i.e., its path), use the which program in bash.

Since the number of arguments varies from program to program, you are not allowed to declare a fixedsize array for the second argument of execve(). Instead, you must count the number of arguments for each user-entered program and use malloc(3) to allocate just enough memory for the array.

You should not invoke a system call if it‚Äôs simple to determine from the internal state that the system call would do nothing, and you should monitor the status of any forked child process. (For example, your shell should ignore empty or all-whitespace lines instead of always calling fork(2).)

1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl-C behavior

Ctrl-C (SIGINT) is a very helpful signal often used from the shell to terminate the current running process. Child processes started from <em>penn-shredder </em>should respond to Ctrl-C by following their normal behavior on SIGINT, but <em>penn-shredder </em>itself should not exit (even when Ctrl-C is typed without a child process running). Instead, your shell must catch SIGINT and re-prompt (after printing a newline character if appropriate):

$ penn-shredder penn-shredder# /bin/cat ÀÜC penn-shredder# ÀÜC penn-shredder# sleepÀÜC penn-shredder# /bin/sleep 1 penn-shredder#

1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl-D behavior

If the user presses Ctrl-D at the beginning of the input line, your shell must exit. If the user types Ctrl-D when the input line is not empty, your shell should not exit; instead, the input is sent to read(2) and you should print a newline character.

1.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments to <em>penn-shredder</em>

The <em>penn-shredder </em>program must take an optional argument: the execution timeout. If the value of the argument is 0, then <em>penn-shredder </em>imposes no time restriction on child processes. For example, an optional argument of 10 results in a timeout of 10 seconds:

$ penn-shredder 10

Omitting the optional argument results in no timeouts. You must error out if the value of the argument is negative or more than one argument is provided. In either case, <em>penn-shredder </em>should return a nonzero (EXITFAILURE) status.

<h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Handling</h1>
Most system calls and library functions report errors via the return value. You must check for errors for those with an asterisk in Section 5 below.

<h1>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code Organization</h1>
Sane code organization is critical for all software. Your code should not be all in one giant penn-shredder.c file. Rather, you should create reasonable modules and expose the relevant interfaces and constants in .h files. Make sure that your source code (.c and .h files) is in the top-level directory and can be built by the autograder‚Äôs Makefile using the following command:

$ make -B

Your code should adhere to DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself). If you are writing code that is used in more than one place, you should write a function or a macro.

<h1>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory Errors</h1>
You are required to check your code for memory errors. This is a nontrivial task, but an extremely important one. Code with memory leaks and memory violations will incur deductions. Fortunately, there is a very nice tool valgrind that is available to help you. You must find and fix any bugs that valgrind locates, but there is no guarantee it will find <em>all </em>memory errors in your code. Below is a sample run of <em>penn-shredder </em>in valgrind:

<h1>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandatory Additional Credit</h1>
For 2% of your final grade implement the following mandatory additional credit: don‚Äôt use kill(2). This is in addition to, not in place of, the regular credits. You must wrap your additional credit code with the C macro ECNOKILL as follows:

<table width="633">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="633">#ifdef EC_NOKILL

// mandatory additional credit code #else

// regular credit code

#endif

#ifdef EC_NOKILL

// mandatory additional credit code

#endif

#ifndef EC_NOKILL

// regular credit code

#endif
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Don‚Äôt do #define ECNOKILL anywhere in your code. The autograder will define it via make as follows:

$ make -B CPPFLAGS=-DEC_NOKILL

<h1>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing Your Code</h1>
In general, there are two environments for you to develop projects in this course: (1) Docker Container or (2) <em>SpecLab </em>servers for remote developing. We recommend the first environment.

For the first choice, we provide a Docker Image for your convenience to create a course-standardized container. You can find the set-up instructions on Ed. We highly recommend you to use it as your developing environment because all grading will be done on it. Please do not develop on macOS directly as there are significant differences between macOS and Unix variants such as Ubuntu Linux. If you decide to develop on a different environment anyway, you must compile and test your <em>penn-shredder </em>on the course-standardized environment to ensure your <em>penn-shredder </em>runs as you expect during grading.

For the second choice, <em>SpecLab </em>will be available to you as CIS 5480 students, however, we discourage its usage unless your personal machine has super, super weak performance specifications such as a single core machine with 2GB of RAM or less. <em>SpecLab </em>is a collection of older desktops that run the same Linux variant as <em>eniac</em>, and most importantly, you can crash them as much as you want without causing too much chaos. You access <em>SpecLab </em>remotely over <em>ssh</em>. There are roughly 10 <em>SpecLab </em>machines up at any time. When you are ready to develop, choose a random number between 01 and 50, or so, and then issue this command:

$ ssh specDD.seas.upenn.edu

where DD is replaced with the number you chose. If that machine is not responding, then add one to that number and try again. Not all <em>SpecLab </em>machines are currently up, but most are. You must be on SEASnet to directly <em>ssh </em>into <em>SpecLab</em>. The RESnet (your dorms) is not on SEASnet, but the machines in the Moore computer lab are. If you are not on SEASnet, you may still remotely access <em>SpecLab </em>by first <em>ssh</em>-ing into eniac and then <em>ssh</em>-ing into <em>SpecLab</em>.

Do not develop your code on <em>eniac</em>. CIS 5480 students are notorious for crashing <em>eniac </em>in creative ways, normally via a ‚Äúfork-bomb.‚Äù This always seems to happen about two hours before a homework deadline, and the result is chaos, not just for our class, but for everyone else using <em>eniac</em>.

Students who are caught running <em>penn-shredder </em>directly on <em>eniac </em>will be penalized.

<h1>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What to turn in</h1>
You must provide each of the following for your submission, <em>no matter what</em>. Failure to do so may reflect in your grade.

<ol>
<li>README file. In the README you will provide
<ul>
<li>Your name and PennKey</li>
<li>A list of submitted source files</li>
<li>Overview of work accomplished</li>
<li>Description of code and code layout</li>
<li>General comments and anything that can help us grade your code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your code. You may think this is a joke, but at least once a year, someone forgets to include it.</li>
</ol>
<h1>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submission</h1>
Submission should be done through Canvas. Please compress your files via the following:

tar cvaf yourpennkey-project0.tar.gz *.c *.h README

As explained above, please remember to include your README and any header files you have written, along with your main <em>penn-shredder </em>source code. Canvas will accept multiple submissions, but we will grade only the most recent submission submitted before the submission deadline.

<h1>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grading Guidelines</h1>
<ul>
<li>1% GitHub Username</li>
<li>4% Documentation</li>
<li>90% Functionality</li>
<li>5% Peer Review (will be released later)</li>
</ul>
Please note that general deductions may occur for a variety of programming errors including memory violations, lack of error checking, poor code organization, etc.

You may use any comment style you wish, but we highly suggest using DOxygen style comments as they promote fully documenting function inputs, outputs, and error cases. A useful guide to this comment style can be found here: https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html

After the submission, you will evaluate another student‚Äôs code based on a given rubric using a profiling tool such as valgrind and sanitizers. Keep a lookout on <em>edStem </em>for more details about this after your submission.

Your programs will be graded on the course-standardized environments and must execute as specified there. Although you may develop and test on your local machine, you should always test that your program functions properly there.

<h1>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attribution</h1>
This is a large and complex assignment, using arcane and compactly documented APIs. We do not expect you to be able to complete it without relying on some outside references. That said, we do expect you to struggle a lot, which is how you will learn about systems programming, by <em>doing things yourself</em>. Please feel free to refer to work you have done in previous Penn courses (such as CIS 240); it can be a helpful reminder for things like Makefiles and general C syntax.

The primary rule to keep you safe from plagiarism/cheating in this project is to attribute in your documentation any outside sources you use. This includes both resources used to help you understand the concepts, and resources containing sample code you incorporated in your shell. The course text and APUE need only be cited in the latter case. You should also use external code sparingly. Using most of an example from the pipe(2) man page is ok; using the ParseInputAndCreateJobAndHandleSignals() function from <em>Foo‚Äôs Handy Write Your Own Shell Tutorial </em>is not (both verbatim, and as a closely followed template on structuring your shell).
